STACKS

- Are LIFO - last item inserted is the first one we take out
- Operation are pop(), push(), peek()
- graph algoithm rely heavily on stacks such as depth-first search can be implemented with stacks
- there are 2 main types of memory. 
    - stack monmory and heap memory
- stack memory is in the RAM
    - small in size
    - fast access
    - stores function calls and local variables
    - no fragmentation
- objects are store on the heap memory
    - Large in size
    - slow access
    - stores objects
    - may become fragmented

Data struture:
    push()
    pop()
    peek()
    is_empty()
    stack_size()

Real world cases

- Back buttons on web browsers
- undo Operation in software
- stores local variables and functions calls

Stack are a abstract data types
- underlaying data struture can be an array or linked list
